# Development

## First steps

- Run `yarn precompile-handlebars` to precompile Handlebars templates
- Run `yarn generate-cadence-code` to generate Javascript files, which would export Cadence code
  together with other template information

## Publish

Package will be automatically published via CD/CI tools, when new changes are merged into `master`
branch, no need to do extra steps.
